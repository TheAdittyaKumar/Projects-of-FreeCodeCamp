          BRAC University’s team, BRACU Duburi, has made history by securing the second position in the prestigious RoboSub 2023 competition held in San Diego, California. This achievement underscores the team's relentless dedication to advancing autonomous underwater technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BRACU Duburi AUV, now in its 4th iteration, features several critical enhancements that played a pivotal role in this success. The team's innovative approach to design and engineering, which included a shift to a hydrodynamic octagonal hull, significantly improved underwater maneuverability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the integration of advanced technologies like the Vectornav VN200 INS and a robust lithium-ion battery system has made Duburi more reliable and efficient in handling complex tasks underwater. This year's competition was a true test of the team's skill, creativity, and perseverance.
